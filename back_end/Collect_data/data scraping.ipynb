Vanderlip, another with whom he had a grievance. Spencer was cornered by police as he attempted to escape through the school cafeteria; as one officer aimed, Spencer pressed the .22 caliber automatic pistol against his right side and fired twice, critically wounding himself. Police later found a suicide note from Spencer to his wife, Polly. He survived his wounds and was tried for murder. Pleading guilty to all charges, he received 5 consecutive life terms. He was discharged from California's Department of Correction in 1977, aged 75. Verlin Spencer died January 11, 1991.[96][97][98][99]\"},\n",

Ms. Ball\\'s classroom had recently moved across the campus, something Barry didn\\'t know at the time. He ran across the roof and jumped down into the courtyard before entering the building and starting his search. After some time, he finally gave up the hunt, yelled out \"Homecoming, homecoming,\" and sprayed the school\\'s foyer with 30 rounds of ammunition. His bullets struck windows and the ceiling, but none of the dozen or so students who were also in the foyer at the time. However, a male student was injured by flying debris. Principal Ray Williams arrived after Barry had fired his last shot to confront him. Barry threw both rifles at Ray, saying \"I did it.\" Ray had Barry sit down and wait for the police while he inspected his students for injuries. Barry offered no resistance. He was wearing a white t-shirt under a khaki-colored vest with flap pockets, blue jeans and cowboy boots when he was arrested. Over the weekend, it was discovered that Barry had killed Dallas karate instructor Jimmy Glen Wilson and wounded Rudy Smedley earlier in the week with the submachine gun. He was charged with two counts of intent to commit murder, one count of retaliation and one count of murder.[204]'},\n",
